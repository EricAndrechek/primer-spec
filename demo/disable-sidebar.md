# Disable Sidebar

This page demonstrates [page configuration options](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec/blob/develop/docs/USAGE_ADVANCED.md#other-page-configuration-options) in Primer Spec.

This page has been configured with the following option:

### `disableSidebar: true`

This boolean indicates whether the sidebar with Table of Contents should be shown on the page. The option defaults to `false` (so that the sidebar is made available). Notice, however, that on this page, _there is no Sidebar_!

This configuration option is useful for small pages, or for pages with few headings. (On such pages, a Sidebar may not be useful, or might hamper the reading experience.)
