# Hide Sidebar on Load

This page demonstrates [page configuration options](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec/blob/develop/docs/USAGE_ADVANCED.md#other-page-configuration-options) in Primer Spec.

This page has been configured with the following option:

### `hideSidebarOnLoad: true`

This boolean indicates whether the sidebar with Table of Contents should be shown when a user loads the page. The option defaults to `false` (so that the sidebar always shows). Notice, however, that on this page, the sidebar is collapsed by default.
