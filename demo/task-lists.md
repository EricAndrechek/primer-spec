This page demonstrates how Primer Spec persists task-lists.

Here's a task-list:

- [ ] This task is unchecked by default.
- [ ] This task is also unchecked by default.
- [x] This task is **checked** by default.

Check or uncheck any of the checkboxes above, and then refresh the page. The checkboxes' state will remain the same between page-reloads!

Also note that the checkbox-state is persisted per-page. This means that your actions on the checkboxes in [index.html](../#learning-goals) will not affect the checkboxes here, and vice-versa.
