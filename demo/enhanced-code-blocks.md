# Introduction

If you've used Markdown, you probably already know that you can insert code blocks using syntax like this:

````markdown
```python
import os
print("Hello world!")
```
````

Primer Spec **_enhances_** plain old code blocks with the following features:

- [ ] **_Line numbers_** ðŸš€
- [ ] Clicking a line number **_selects the line_**. It's easy to copy a single line!
  - [ ] You can even click-and-drag to select multiple lines simultaneously!
- [ ] **_Copy the entire block_** with a single button.
- [ ] Instructors can **_highlight_** specific lines!

# Examples

## Basic example

```
Shall I compare thee to a summerâ€™s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summerâ€™s lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmâ€™d;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or natureâ€™s changing course untrimmâ€™d;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Nor shall Death brag thou wanderâ€™st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
```

In the above block, the second [quatrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain) of the sonnet has been highlighted, along with the first line of the [volta](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volta_(literature)>).

Highlights are specified as a single string containing one or more ranges of line numbers separated by commas. A range consists of a single line number, or an inclusive range of line numbers separated by a hypen.

In the above example, we specify the highlights as:

```
data-highlight="5-8,13"
```

import json

## Console example

Console blocks have special handling. Try clicking the line number next to line 1, line 3 or line 9 of the following code block:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```console
$ pwd
/Users/awdeorio/src/eecs485/p2-insta485-serverside
$ tree insta485/static/
insta485/static/
â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css
â””â”€â”€ images
    â””â”€â”€ logo.png
$ touch insta485/model.py
```
{: data-highlight="1,3,9" }
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Notice how selecting a line ONLY selects the command after the prompt symbol (`$`). This makes it easy to copy console commands!
