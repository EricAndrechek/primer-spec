# Enhanced Code Blocks

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

# Introduction

If you've used Markdown, you probably already know that you can insert code blocks using syntax like this:

````markdown
```python
import os
print("Hello world!")
```
````

Primer Spec **_enhances_** plain old code blocks with the following features:

- [ ] **_Line numbers_** ðŸš€
- [ ] Clicking a line number **_selects the line_**. It's easy to copy a single line!
  - [ ] You can even click-and-drag to select multiple lines simultaneously!
- [ ] **_Copy the entire block_** with a single button.
- [ ] Instructors can [**_highlight_** specific lines](#highlighted-lines)
- [ ] Instructors can name their code blocks by [adding a title](#title-code-block-header).

If you want, you can use a different "variant" / appearance for your code blocks. See [Using variants](#using-variants).

# Examples

## Basic example

```
Shall I compare thee to a summerâ€™s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summerâ€™s lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmâ€™d;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or natureâ€™s changing course untrimmâ€™d;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Nor shall Death brag thou wanderâ€™st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
```

Try clicking the line numbers to select individual lines!

In the above block, the second [quatrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain) of the sonnet has been highlighted, along with the first line of the [volta](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volta_(literature)>).

Highlights are specified as a single string containing one or more ranges of line numbers separated by commas. A range consists of a single line number, or an inclusive range of line numbers separated by a hypen.

In the above example, we specify the highlights as:

```
data-highlight="5-8,13"
```

## Console example

Console blocks have special handling. Try clicking the line number next to line 1, line 3 or line 9 of the following code block:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```console
$ pwd # prints the current working directory
/Users/awdeorio/src/eecs485/p2-insta485-serverside
$ tree insta485/static/
insta485/static/
â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css
â””â”€â”€ images
    â””â”€â”€ logo.png
$ touch insta485/model.py
$ mapreduce-manager \
    --host localhost \
    --port 6000 \
    --hb-port 5999 \
    --log-file mapreduce-manager.log &
Error: Not implemented
```
{: data-highlight="1,3,9" }
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Notice how selecting a line ONLY selects the command after the prompt symbol (`$`). This makes it easy to copy console commands!

$ touch insta485/model.py
$ mapreduce-manager \
    --host localhost \

    --log-file mapreduce-manager.log &

```

## `pycon` console example

Although `pycon` ("Python Console") isn't a supported "language" by the syntax-highlighter, you can emulate its behavior by specifying parameters to the `console` syntax highlighter:

```console?lang=python&prompt=>>>,...
>>> from task import MapTask
>>> task = MapTask(
...   input_files=["file01", "file02"],
...   executable="map0.py", output_directory="output")
>>> task
MapTask(input_files=['file01', 'file02'], executable=map.py, output_directory=output)
```

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Source code for this <code>pycon</code> code block</summary>
  
  ````markdown
```console?lang=python&prompt=>>>,...
>>> from task import MapTask
>>> task = MapTask(
...   input_files=["file01", "file02"],
...   executable="map0.py", output_directory="output")
>>> task
MapTask(input_files=['file01', 'file02'], executable=map.py, output_directory=output)
```
  ````
</details>

## Title (code block header)

You can optionally specify a "title" for the code block â€”Â perhaps it could be a filename â€” to be displayed above the code block. Specify it by adding the `data-title` attribute. Here's an example:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```python
import numpy as np

def pagerank(M, num_iterations=100, d=0.85):
    N = M.shape[1]
    v = np.random.rand(N, 1)
    v = v / np.linalg.norm(v, 1)
    iteration = 0
    while iteration < num_iterations:
        iteration += 1
        v = d * np.matmul(M, v) + (1 - d) / N
    return v
```
{: data-title="Simplified PageRank implementation" }
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<details markdown="1">

def pagerank(M, num_iterations=100, d=0.85):
    N = M.shape[1]
    v = np.random.rand(N, 1)
    v = v / np.linalg.norm(v, 1)
    iteration = 0
    while iteration < num_iterations:
        iteration += 1
        v = d * np.matmul(M, v) + (1 - d) / N
    return v
```

# Variants

The default code block style should work for most use cases. However, you might want to show text/code in a different style, for instance, with no line numbers.

Primer Spec supports three different styles (aka 'variants') of code blocks:
- **`enhanced` (default)**: This is the style you've seen in all of the above demos.
- [**`no-line-numbers`**](#no-line-numbers): Like `enhanced`, but the line numbers are not shown.
- [**`legacy`**](#legacy): This is the original style of code blocks from the original [GitHub Primer theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer).

## Using variants

### Single code block

Add the attribute `{: data-variant="<variant>" }` to the code block. For instance:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
````markdown
```console
# This is a LEGACY code block
$ echo "Spam & Eggs"
```
{: data-variant="legacy" }
````
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

If you have set the [page](#entire-page) or [site-wide](#entire-site) configuration options to use legacy code blocks, you can override the setting for a single code block as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
````markdown
```console
# This is an ENHANCED code block
$ echo "Spam & Eggs"
```
{: data-variant="enhanced" }
````
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Entire page

Add the page configuration option `defaultCodeblockVariant: legacy` to the top of the page. To learn more about page configuration options, see [USAGE_ADVANCED.md#page-configuration-options](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec/blob/develop/docs/USAGE_ADVANCED.md#page-configuration-options).

If you have set the [site-wide](#entire-site) configuration option to use legacy code blocks, you can override the setting for a single page by settings `defaultCodeblockVariant: enhanced` at the top of the page.

### Entire site

Add the site-wide configuration option `defaultCodeblockVariant: legacy` under the `primerSpec` settings in `_config.yml`. To learn more about site configuration options, see [USAGE_ADVANCED.md#site-configuration-options](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec/blob/develop/docs/USAGE_ADVANCED.md#site-configuration-options).

## Variant Demos

### `no-line-numbers`

Like `enhanced`, but the line numbers are not shown.

On the far-away island of Sala-ma-Sond,
Yertle the Turtle was king of the pond.
A nice little pond. It was clean. It was neat.
The water was warm. There was plenty to eat.
The turtles had everything turtles might need.
And they were all happy. Quite happy indeed.

### `legacy`

This is the original style of code blocks from the original [GitHub Primer theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```console
$ echo "Spam & Eggs"
```
{: data-variant="legacy" }
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

In my opinion, the legacy style works best with single-line code blocks.

If you'd like to revert to using the "legacy" style, decide whether you'd like to revert a single code block or all code blocks in the page or in the site.
